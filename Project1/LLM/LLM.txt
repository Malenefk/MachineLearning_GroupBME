Information about the use of ChatGPT:

In this project, we have used ChatGPT for help with
the following:
• Used to help with the implementation of code. The
numerical solutions are all created by the authors
of this project, but ChatGPT has been used to in-
crease efficiency in handling errors in the Python
code and making plots.
• Used to ask questions about uncertainties in the
project description.
• The website Grammarly has been used as a tool
for avoiding spelling mistakes. Only the free ver-
sion has been used, meaning it helps with spelling
mistakes, but it does not rewrite or improve the
contents of the report.

Examples of usage:

"What do they mean aboout creating a LLM folder"
"I need to divide the subplot into two subplots instead, can you help make a faster code to do so"
"What is wrong with this code"
