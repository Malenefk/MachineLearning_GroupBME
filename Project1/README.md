# Project 1 - FYSSTK4155

# Authors: Birk Skogsrud, Elias Bj√∏rgum Micaelsen-Fuglesang & Malene Fjeldsrud Karlsen

Project 1 in Machine Learning is based on creating a polynomial fit the function Runge's function. Project one includes scripts, plots and a scientific report describing the process and the results. 

The Project 1 folder is divided into several folders. Beneath is an explanation on how to navigate:
* Code
    * One folder called task1a-1f. This folder includes four notebooks running the codes found in functions.py. These are the same codes used to plot the figures found in the report. The functions.py file is a python script contianing all functions needed to reproduce the results for task 1a, 1b, 1c and 1d. A requirments text file for these specific task are also in the folder. 
    * One folder called task1e-1h. This folder includes scripts needed to reproduce the results for task 1e, 1f, 1g and 1h. A requirments text file for these specific task are also in the folder.

* LLM
    * Contains information on how we have used ChatGPT in the project. 

* Report
    * Contains a PDF of our finalized scientific report.
